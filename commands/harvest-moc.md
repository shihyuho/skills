description: "Create or update Harvest topic MOCs from existing context notes with confirmation-first behavior."
---

Manage MOCs for the Harvest second brain.

## Steps

1. Read `docs/notes/00-INDEX.md` and `docs/notes/contexts/`.
2. Identify candidate topics (prefer topics with 3+ related contexts and no MOC).
3. Propose one or more target MOCs and ask for confirmation.
4. Create or update `docs/notes/mocs/<topic>.md` using `references/MOC_TEMPLATE.md` conventions.
5. Update `docs/notes/00-INDEX.md` Topics section.

## Rules

- Keep link-based structure; do not duplicate full context bodies.
- If user does not confirm, do not write files.
- Keep updates compact and reversible.

Finish with a short summary of updated files.
