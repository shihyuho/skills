Treat this command as a review entrypoint.

Use `skills/harvest/SKILL.md` as the single source of truth, specifically:

- `## Deterministic Workflow (Required)`

- `## Verification Checklist`

Write one report file under `docs/notes/harvest-quality/` using the review template contract.

Do not redefine review criteria or report schema in this command.
