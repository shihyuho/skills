description: "Show current harvest status for source-of-truth and second-brain structure."

Invoke the `harvest:harvest` skill and follow it exactly as presented.

Treat this command as a status entrypoint.

Use `skills/harvest/SKILL.md` as the single source of truth, specifically:

- `## Core Contract`
- `## Output Locations`
- `## Verification Checklist`
- `## Failure Handling`

Return a compact status report based on those definitions.

Do not redefine required file lists or status criteria in this command.
