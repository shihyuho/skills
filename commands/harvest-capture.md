description: "Capture current work into second-brain timeline immediately."

Invoke the `harvest:harvest` skill and follow it exactly as presented.

Force a key-update snapshot for current work now:

- append a timeline event with `when`, `change`, `why`, `source_ref`
- use same-day append behavior when timeline file already exists
- avoid formal decision/knowledge publication unless milestone conditions are met
