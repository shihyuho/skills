Invoke the `harvest:harvest` skill and follow it exactly as presented.

Treat this command as a capture entrypoint.

Use `skills/harvest/SKILL.md` as the single source of truth, specifically:

- `## Publishing Strategy`
- `## Execution Contract (Required)`

Force a key-update snapshot for current work now, without redefining snapshot fields or dedupe rules in this command.
