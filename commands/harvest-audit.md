Invoke the `harvest:harvest` skill and follow it exactly as presented.

Treat this command as an audit entrypoint.

Use `skills/harvest/SKILL.md` as the single source of truth, specifically:

- `## Source Extraction Boundaries (Required)`
- `## Anti-Recursion Guard`
- `## Verification Checklist`

Return a brief pass/fail summary with concrete file paths for each issue.

Do not redefine audit criteria in this command.
