Invoke the `harvest:harvest` skill and follow it exactly as presented.

Treat this command as a start entrypoint.

Use `skills/harvest/SKILL.md` as the single source of truth, specifically:

- `## First-Run Bootstrap (Required)`
- `## Execution Contract (Required)`

Do not redefine bootstrap file lists or rules in this command.
