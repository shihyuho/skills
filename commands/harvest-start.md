Invoke the `harvest:harvest` skill and follow it exactly as presented.

Before normal publishing, run first-run bootstrap behavior and confirm these files exist:

- `docs/notes/index.md`
- `docs/notes/projects.md`
- `docs/notes/decisions.md`
- `docs/notes/knowledge.md`
- `docs/notes/projects/.templates/timeline-template.md`
- `docs/notes/decisions/.templates/decision-template.md`
- `docs/notes/knowledge/.templates/knowledge-template.md`

After bootstrap, continue normal harvest behavior.
