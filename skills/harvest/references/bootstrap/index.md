# Project Second Brain

> [!info]
> This folder stores curated project knowledge derived from source-of-truth files:
> `task_plan.md`, `findings.md`, and `progress.md`.

## Quick Navigation

- [[projects|Projects]]
- [[decisions|Decisions]]
- [[knowledge|Knowledge]]
- [[harvest-quality|Harvest Quality]]

## Conventions

- Keep notes concise, reusable, and traceable.
- Add `source_files` and `source_date` in formal notes.
- Do not mirror full source-of-truth content.

## Suggested Next Notes

- Create first timeline note in `projects/<project>/timeline/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
- Add first formal decision in `decisions/`.
- Add first reusable insight in `knowledge/`.
- Add first quality review in `harvest-quality/YYYY-MM-DD-<project-slug>-harvest-review.md`.
- Add first optimization rollup in `harvest-quality/rollups/YYYY-MM-<project-slug>-harvest-optimization.md`.
