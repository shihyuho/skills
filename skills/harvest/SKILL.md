# Planning Second Brain

Create and maintain a project second brain without replacing source-of-truth planning files.

## Core Contract

- Treat `task_plan.md`, `findings.md`, and `progress.md` as the only source of truth (SOT).
- Write second-brain outputs into `docs/notes` using Obsidian-compatible Markdown.
- Never let `docs/notes` overwrite or redefine source-of-truth files.
- Route all entrypoints through one deterministic capture workflow.

## Required Skill Composition

1. Invoke `planning-with-files` first for primary planning workflow.
2. Invoke `obsidian-markdown` when writing or updating second-brain Markdown.

## Trigger Contract

Use this skill when users ask to:

- keep project memory over time
- summarize milestones into reusable notes
- record stable decisions and knowledge
- build an Obsidian-friendly project knowledge base
- read intents: find prior decision, look up past context, trace project timeline, retrieve existing second-brain note

Do not use this skill for unrelated implementation work that does not involve capture, summarization, or project memory publishing.

## Output Locations

- `docs/notes/index.md`
- `docs/notes/projects.md`
- `docs/notes/decisions.md`
- `docs/notes/knowledge.md`
- `docs/notes/harvest-quality.md`
- `docs/notes/projects/<project>/timeline/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- `docs/notes/decisions/*.md`
- `docs/notes/knowledge/*.md`
- `docs/notes/harvest-quality/YYYY-MM-DD-<project-slug>-harvest-review.md`
- `docs/notes/harvest-quality/rollups/YYYY-MM-<project-slug>-harvest-optimization.md`

Create missing folders/files when absent.

## Progressive Disclosure Read Workflow (Required)

Follow this read order before any retrieval or context lookup:

1. Read `docs/notes/index.md` to discover available hubs.
2. Read the intent hub: `docs/notes/projects.md`, `docs/notes/decisions.md`, or `docs/notes/knowledge.md`.
3. Read only targeted leaf notes that match the intent.

Stop condition:

- Stop when the target note is found, or after two consecutive reads that add no novel information.

Hard constraints:

- Never start from deep leaves unless the user provides an exact path.
- Treat `docs/notes` as retrieval-only; never capture or summarize `docs/notes` back into `docs/notes`.
- Preserve the anti-recursion guard and existing SOT-only contract (`task_plan.md`, `findings.md`, `progress.md`).
- Do not expand read scope beyond the minimal files needed for the requested intent.

Reference example:

- [references/progressive-disclosure-read-example.md](references/progressive-disclosure-read-example.md)

## Deterministic Workflow (Required)

Run this workflow in order for every entrypoint (manual trigger phrases, slash-command wrappers, and plugin-driven invocation):

1. **Preflight**
   - Confirm SOT inputs exist: `task_plan.md`, `findings.md`, `progress.md`.
   - Confirm output root: `docs/notes`.
   - Set mode: `capture`, `status`, `audit`, `review`, or `optimize`.
   - For `optimize` mode, collect optional user-provided report directories as additional input roots.
2. **Bootstrap**
   - Ensure required minimal `docs/notes` files and templates exist.
   - Apply contract in [references/publishing-and-dedupe.md](references/publishing-and-dedupe.md).
3. **Extract Candidates**
   - Apply contracts in [references/extraction-and-classification.md](references/extraction-and-classification.md).
4. **Classify**
   - Route each candidate using the classification decision table contract.
5. **Publish**
   - Append same-day timeline events and update decision/knowledge notes with dedupe.
6. **Verify and Report**
   - Run verification checklist.
   - For `review` and `optimize`, apply [references/quality-reports.md](references/quality-reports.md).

## Candidate Schema and Extraction Rules (Required)

Candidate fields MUST include:

- `source_ref`, `change`, `why`, `candidate_type`, `confidence`
- optional: `sot_fingerprint`, `exclusion_reason`, `unresolved_source_ref`

Apply full extraction/classification contract in [references/extraction-and-classification.md](references/extraction-and-classification.md).

## Publish Confirmation Semantics (Required)

1. Extract candidate.
2. Validate schema fields and thresholds.
3. Publish into target note.
4. Mark committed after publish succeeds.

Apply full publishing contract in [references/publishing-and-dedupe.md](references/publishing-and-dedupe.md).

## First-Run Bootstrap (Required)

If `docs/notes` is missing, or if any required minimal file is missing, bootstrap from `references/bootstrap/`.

Apply the required minimal files list and bootstrap rules in [references/publishing-and-dedupe.md](references/publishing-and-dedupe.md).

## Publishing Strategy

Apply classification, timeline, and milestone publish contracts in [references/extraction-and-classification.md](references/extraction-and-classification.md).

## Review Report Mode (Required)

Use `review` mode to evaluate harvest output quality and persist one reusable report for later optimization planning.

Apply full review contract in [references/quality-reports.md](references/quality-reports.md).

## Review Rollup Mode (Required)

Use `optimize` mode to aggregate multiple review reports into one optimization roadmap.

Apply full rollup contract in [references/quality-reports.md](references/quality-reports.md).

## Execution Contract (Required)

- Treat trigger methods as entrypoints only (manual phrases, slash-command wrappers, plugin-driven calls).
- MUST route all entrypoints through the same deterministic workflow.
- Produce equivalent output for equivalent source input regardless of trigger method.
- Do not implement separate dedupe behavior per trigger entrypoint.
- Keep plugin-driven capture behavior contract-compatible with manual entrypoints.
- Keep `review` and `optimize` modes repo-agnostic. Do not hardcode project-specific heuristics as universal rules.

## Source Extraction Boundaries (Required)

Extract with allowlist rules from source-of-truth files. Do not summarize everything.

Apply full allowlist/denylist and thresholds in [references/extraction-and-classification.md](references/extraction-and-classification.md).

## Harvest Exclusion Markers

Support explicit exclusion markers inside source-of-truth files:

- `<!-- harvest:exclude:start -->`
- `<!-- harvest:exclude:end -->`

Ignore content inside this block during harvest publishing.

## Anti-Recursion Guard

- Do not summarize notes under `docs/notes` back into new notes.
- Use source-of-truth files as input only (`task_plan.md`, `findings.md`, `progress.md`).
- Skip entries that only describe harvest's own publishing activity.

## Dedupe and Fingerprint Contract (Required)

- Timeline events MUST include `sot_fingerprint`.
- Compute `sot_fingerprint` from normalized `source_ref + change + why`.
- Same timeline day + same `sot_fingerprint` means no-op (do not append duplicate block).
- Equivalent source input must produce equivalent no-op behavior across manual and plugin entrypoints.

Fingerprint normalization:

1. Trim leading/trailing whitespace on `source_ref`, `change`, and `why`.
2. Collapse internal whitespace to single spaces.
3. Lowercase each part.
4. Join as `<source_ref>||<change>||<why>`.
5. Compute SHA-256 hex lowercase.

Reference example:

- [references/publishing-and-dedupe.md](references/publishing-and-dedupe.md)

## Note Rules

- Keep notes concise and reusable.
- Include traceability metadata in formal notes.
- Summarize; do not paste large verbatim source-of-truth sections.

## Verification Checklist

Before finalizing updates:

1. Every formal note has `source_files`, `source_date`, and `source_ref`.
2. Every timeline event has `source_ref` and `sot_fingerprint`.
3. `docs/notes/index.md` links to latest decisions and knowledge.
4. No reverse edits were made to `task_plan.md`, `findings.md`, `progress.md` by second-brain steps.
5. No large copied source-of-truth blocks appear in formal notes.
6. In `review` mode, report file includes scorecard, deductions, and path-based evidence.
7. In `optimize` mode, rollup file includes coverage counts, aggregated scores, roadmap priority, and source report paths.
8. In `optimize` mode, rollup file includes input root resolution results (included + skipped + reasons).

## Failure Handling

- If `source_ref` cannot be resolved, set note `status: draft` and record `unresolved_source_ref`.
- Do not block the source-of-truth workflow because of second-brain publish errors.

## Non-Goals

- Do not modify global IDE/user rule files.
- Do not add mandatory always-on conversation loops.
- Do not turn this skill into a general cross-skill memory engine.
- Do not collect or persist tool chatter as project knowledge.

## Anti-Patterns

- Treating second-brain notes as execution-state files.
- Creating parallel truth that conflicts with source-of-truth planning files.
- Defining trigger-specific behavior that diverges from the deterministic workflow.
