# Lessons Learned

A self-improvement loop that stores atomic Zettelkasten lesson cards and recalls relevant
lessons before work. Designed to be invoked by other skills, not used standalone.

## Prerequisites

**MUST** read `references/bootstrap.md` when the task modifies `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`.

## Trigger Contract

Invoke this skill in these moments:

- **Task start**: Run recall before implementation.
- **During task**: Run capture when the user corrects your approach.
- **Task end**: Evaluate capture criteria and auto-capture qualifying lessons.

Do not trigger for:

- One-off factual Q&A with no reusable process.
- Pure concept explanation without actionable guidance.
- Formatting-only or administrative edits with no technical lesson.
- Non-reproducible context with no stable prevention rule.

## Minimal Execution Guardrails

When this skill is the primary process skill in a session:

- For non-trivial work (3+ steps), create a task tracker before implementation.
- Before claiming completion, run relevant verification commands and report evidence.
- Do not replace verification with assumptions or partial checks.

## Storage

All lessons live under **`docs/lessons/`** at the project root:

```
docs/lessons/
├── _index.md
├── api-timeout-retry-pattern.md
├── db-migration-run-order.md
└── null-check-before-save.md
```

## Recall Phase — Before Starting Work

Run this phase before writing code.

1. Extract task keywords (technology, failure mode, domain terms).
2. Apply index recovery rule:
   - If `docs/lessons/_index.md` is missing and no lesson cards exist, treat as first run and skip recall.
   - If `_index.md` is missing but lesson cards exist, rebuild `_index.md` from card frontmatter, then continue recall and report index recovery.
3. Read `docs/lessons/_index.md`.
4. Match keywords against index tags and load **1-3** primary cards.
5. Expand with `related` links from primary cards, load up to **2** additional cards.
6. Enforce hard cap: primary + related cards must not exceed **5** total.
7. Apply loaded lessons as constraints for current work and mention loaded card IDs briefly.

If no cards match, continue work without lesson constraints.

## Capture Phase — After Completing Work

Run this phase when any of these conditions are met:
- The user corrected your approach
- A bug fix revealed a reusable pattern
- A task completion surfaced a non-obvious reusable insight

### Step 1 — Decide whether to capture

Ask: *"Will this lesson save time next time a similar task appears?"*

Capture if:
- ✅ Reusable pattern or decision rule
- ✅ Costly mistake with a clear prevention strategy
- ✅ Key parameter, config, or precondition that is easy to forget
- ✅ Multi-attempt solution (include failure reasons + success conditions)

Skip if:
- ❌ One-off Q&A with no reusable process
- ❌ Pure concept explanation without actionable guidance
- ❌ Non-reproducible, context-specific conclusion

### Step 2 — Write the Zettel card

Generate a semantic kebab-case ID that describes the lesson (e.g., `api-timeout-retry-pattern`).

Write the card to `docs/lessons/<id>.md` using the template in
[references/card-template.md](references/card-template.md).

Before creating a new card, check semantic duplication:

- If an existing card is semantically similar, update that card instead of creating a duplicate.
- Preserve existing card ID when updating.

Card fields:

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `id` | Semantic kebab-case slug, also the filename |
| `date` | ISO date when the lesson was captured |
| `tags` | 3–6 lowercase tags for recall matching |
| `source` | `user-correction` / `bug-fix` / `retrospective` |
| `related` | 0–3 related lesson references using `[[card-id]]` |
| Title | One-line summary of the lesson |
| Context | What was happening when the mistake occurred |
| Mistake | What went wrong |
| Lesson | Extracted rule or best practice |
| When to Apply | Future situations where this lesson matters |

Task-end behavior:

- If capture criteria are met, auto-capture without asking for permission first.
- After capture, report what was created or updated.

### Step 3 — Update the index

Upsert one row in `docs/lessons/_index.md` per card ID.

If `_index.md` does not exist, create it with this structure:

```markdown
# Lessons Index

> Auto-generated by lessons-learned skill. Do not edit manually.

| Card | Tags | Date |
|---|---|---|
```

Then append the new row.

### Step 4 — Confirm with user

Tell the user what was captured, e.g.:
> ✏️ Captured lesson: `api-timeout-retry-pattern` (tags: api, timeout, retry, error-handling)

## Linking Rule

Use `related` links for high-value cards only.

Create `related` links when at least **2 of 4** conditions are true:

1. Reusable across different tasks.
2. Represents a high-cost mistake (multiple attempts or significant time loss).
3. Depends on critical parameter/config/decision details.
4. Connects naturally to at least two existing lesson cards.

Linking constraints:

- Add 0–3 related links per card.
- Use deterministic ranking from `references/linking-heuristics.md`.
- Do not add weak or speculative links.

Broken related targets:

- If a related target is missing, ignore it and warn.
- Treat this as non-blocking.
- Continue recall/capture flow.

## Validation

Apply these checks during capture or update:

- Card filename equals `id` slug.
- `date` format is ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- `tags` count is 3–6.
- `source` is valid enum.
- `related` count is 0–3 and every target resolves to an existing card.
- Index row exists and matches card metadata.
- Recall limits are respected: 1–3 primary + up to 2 related, max 5 total.

## Integration Guide

Other skills invoke lessons-learned by adding these steps to their workflow:

```markdown
### Lessons Integration
- **Task start**: Invoke `lessons-learned` skill recall phase.
- **User correction**: Invoke `lessons-learned` skill capture phase.
- **Task end**: Evaluate whether a lesson is worth capturing; auto-capture when criteria are met.
- **AGENTS/CLAUDE edits**: Follow `references/bootstrap.md` to enforce canonical block(s).
```

This is a **non-replaceable** step — lesson capture cannot be substituted by
todo trackers, progress files, or other skill artifacts.

## Benchmark Targets

- Trigger precision >= 0.85 on evaluation set.
- Recall usefulness >= 8/10 (human-scored samples).
- Capture compliance >= 9/10.
- Related-link creation rate >= 0.8 when high-value criteria are met.
- Broken-link rate = 0 after validation pass.

## Future Extensions

- **Wikilinks analysis**: Scan all cards to build `[[wikilinks]]` and a knowledge graph on demand.
- **Lesson digest**: Periodically merge related cards into themed summaries.
- **Cross-project sharing**: Aggregate lessons from multiple projects into a personal knowledge base.
