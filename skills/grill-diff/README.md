# grill-diff

Grill the diff. Specialists evaluate every finding internally — only high-value findings reach the user for discussion.

## How It Works

1. **Determine diff scope** — file scope and diff baseline are independent and combine freely.
2. **Gather context** — asks if there is a related spec or plan file.
3. **Read all changed files** — builds the full picture before starting.
4. **Review file by file** — interrogate every aspect of each change.
5. **Specialist filter** — every finding is evaluated by 3 specialists (detective, attacker, gatekeeper). Only confirmed or uncertain findings reach the user.
6. **Discuss** — surviving findings are presented one at a time, discussing until shared understanding.
